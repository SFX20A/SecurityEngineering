# Engineering Repository

This repository is used to store engineering templates with regards to cloud native services and devsecops, which includes my personal engineering and exploratory journey with different cloud service providers, mainly AWS and Azure. This repository will mainly focus on developing reusable templates, scripts or references to enable cybersecurity in the cloud.
